This is a simple project to develop y backend skills, and practice on REST APIs
it seem like a slight confusion, in the defintion of the variable ID the entities, it's better to declare them as UUID variable, not INT, and the code will work just fine
alsso i didn't add the data base setup, so you should cretae it and link it to yours ( in my case i used docker) 
as for the testing database file( you should be able to create and link it with your testing database, i used the H2 data base offered by Springboot)
Also i didn't make no frontendm nut you can fing one in anither repository
I hope this repository, be usefull and educative, and be able to help thos who want it 
thank you !!
